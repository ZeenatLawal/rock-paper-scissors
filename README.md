## Rock-Paper-Scissors
My First try using JavaScript to create a rock-paper-scissors game, spent a lot of time going back through the JavaScript fundamentals before i could complete it. Glad it came out well in the end.
I made a mistake on the computerPlay function and corrected it.

I added a simple UI to the game, it took me a long time to figure out how to rework the code to play through the interface, especially how to get the player selection when the button is clicked. I hope to make the interface look better when I gain more experience.
